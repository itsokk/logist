# logist
Simple and configurable plugin for logging events into a discord webhook.
TODO:
- different hooks for every event
- more customization in each event (like show ips in AsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent, should it censor them etc)
- more events

# NOTICE
The project is kinda dead now because i don't play minecraft and don't manage any server. Might start working on it again in the future
